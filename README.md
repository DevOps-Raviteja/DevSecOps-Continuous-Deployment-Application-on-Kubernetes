# DevSecOps Continuous Deployment Application on Kubernetes
Continuous Deployment (CD) is a software development practice that focuses on automating the process of deploying code changes to production environments. The goal of continuous deployment is to deliver software updates to users as quickly and efficiently as possible, while ensuring high quality and reliability.

# Type of Tools that are involved in this Project

# GitHub:
GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes in code over time.

# Terraform:
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool This helps me To Automate my AWS Resources such as EX: EC2 Instance in my Day-to-Day life.

# Jenkins:
Jenkins is a Open-source & automation server that facilitates Continuous Integraion Continuous Delivery. It allows me to automate work building, tasting, & deploying to the servers.

# Maven 3:
Apache Maven 3 is a widely used build automation and project management tool for Java projects. It simplifies the software build process, manages project dependencies, and provides a standardized structure for Java applications.

# SonarQube:
SonarQube is for continuous inspection of code quality, offering static code analysis to identify and fix code issues. It provides comprehensive reports and metrics, aiding developers in maintaining clean, maintainable, and secure code throughout the development lifecycle.

# SonarQube Quality Gate:
SonarQube Quality Gate is a crucial component that assesses the overall health of a software project based on predefined quality criteria. It acts as a checkpoint, allowing or blocking the promotion of code changes based on set quality thresholds, ensuring that only high-quality code progresses in the development pipeline.

# Kubernetes:
Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration, which is a combination of development and operations practices, focuses on collaboration, automation, and efficiency throughout the software development lifecycle. Kubernetes plays a key role in achieving these goals by providing a scalable and automated container orchestration solution.

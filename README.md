# DevSecOps Continuous Deployment Application on Kubernetes
Continuous Deployment (CD) is a software development practice that focuses on automating the process of deploying code changes to production environments. The goal of continuous deployment is to deliver software updates to users as quickly and efficiently as possible, while ensuring high quality and reliability.

# Type of Tools that are involved in this Project

# GitHub:
GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes in code over time.

# Terraform:
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool This helps me To Automate my AWS Resources such as EX: EC2 Instance in my Day-to-Day life.

# Jenkins:
Jenkins is a Open-source & automation server that facilitates Continuous Integraion Continuous Delivery. It allows me to automate work building, tasting, & deploying to the servers.

# Maven 3:
Apache Maven 3 is a widely used build automation and project management tool for Java projects. It simplifies the software build process, manages project dependencies, and provides a standardized structure for Java applications.

# Junit:
JUnit is a widely used open-source testing framework for Java, providing annotations to define and run tests. It simplifies the process of writing and executing unit tests, helping developers ensure the reliability and correctness of their Java code.

# SonarQube:
SonarQube is for continuous inspection of code quality, offering static code analysis to identify and fix code issues. It provides comprehensive reports and metrics, aiding developers in maintaining clean, maintainable, and secure code throughout the development lifecycle.

# SonarQube Quality Gate:
SonarQube Quality Gate is a crucial component that assesses the overall health of a software project based on predefined quality criteria. It acts as a checkpoint, allowing or blocking the promotion of code changes based on set quality thresholds, ensuring that only high-quality code progresses in the development pipeline.

# Dependency Check:
OWASP Dependency-Check identifies and alerts developers to known vulnerabilities in project dependencies, helping secure applications against potential security threats. It integrates with various build tools and provides actionable reports to enhance the overall security posture of software projects.

# Manual Approval:
Manual approval in deployment pipelines ensures a human gatekeeper verifies critical changes before they reach production, adding an extra layer of scrutiny to prevent potentially harmful releases. This deliberate step allows for thorough evaluation, risk assessment, and alignment with business objectives, promoting a controlled and secure software deployment process

# Apache Tomcat Server:
Apache Tomcat is an open-source application server. Widely used for hosting Java-based web applications, Tomcat provides a lightweight, efficient, and scalable solution for deploying and managing web services.
